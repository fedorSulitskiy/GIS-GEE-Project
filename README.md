# GIS-GEE-Project
In this project I am creating a web application using Flutter for researchers and developers to share and learn new algorithms for GIS using Google Earth Engine API.
[Github](https://github.com/fedorSulitskiy/GIS-GEE-Project) repository is my main workplace, with this [replit repl](https://replit.com/@fedorSulitskiy/GIS-GEE-Project) mirroring progress. I will be using this readme to
demonstrate my progress and detail it on my [Medium page](https://medium.com/@f.sulitskiy). Who ever stumbles upon this repository wish me luck and/or please give me
advice!
